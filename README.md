*It was all a dream...*
<br />
*...right?*

In Mors Somnia, reality and delusion intertwine in a duality of peace and cryptic communion. There are people to meet, creatures to defeat, decisions to be made... but by dream, drug, or idle leasure, each corner comes at a cost.

While awake, you build and barter in an unsuspecting town, living a casual life of trade and creative freedom. While asleep or lost in the haze of a potent elixir, you venture to unexpected lands where secrets lie in wait. Mortality blurs in between -- a transience some citizens seek to harness. Will you aid in their search for power or pave a path of your own?
